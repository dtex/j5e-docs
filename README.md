# J5e Documentation repository

J5e documentaion is located at [j5e.dev](https://j5e.dev)

If you're looking to contribute to J5e documentation you've come to the right place.

## Contributing
The only text managed in this repo are the pages found in getting-started, core-concepts, and the docs home page. The rest of the documentation text is managed in the [J5e](https://github.com/dtex/j5e) repository using JSDoc style inline comments.

The site is built using Eleventy and Liquid templates, with a little preprocessing on the JSDoc data in _data/module-pages.js
